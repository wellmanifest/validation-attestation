# Ticket 002: Onboard protected autonomous validation

- **ID**: ticket-002
- **Owner**: unresolved:human
- **Status**: DONE
- **Workflow state**: DONE
- **Created**: 2026-08-14

## Goal and scope

Add a deterministic GitHub Actions check for the validation attestation
standard, then publish it through the protected Validator App path without
per-PR human approval. The ticket owns CI onboarding only; it does not change
normative attestation semantics.

## Acceptance criteria

- [x] AC-01: `standards / attestation conformance` runs unit tests, the checker
  self-test and bytecode compilation on pull requests and `main`.
- [x] AC-02: Local governance and standard conformance checks pass.
- [x] AC-03: The implementation PR carries exact ticket and correlation
  metadata and remains at `IN_PROGRESS / PUBLICATION` until trusted merge.
- [x] AC-04: The protected ruleset requires current-head governance,
  conformance and one non-author review.
- [x] AC-05: Validator App approves and merges the exact PR head, deletes the
  ticket branch and the merged workflow is readable from `main`.
